To keep things simple, the site is managed as a git repo consisting of a number
of markdown files, optionally backed by a rendering cache of some kind (such as
redis).

Internally, these files end with .md, but when rendered will lack this affix.
Appending this affix will display the unrendered source file.

The markdown files have a metadata header, which can include tags, categories,
&c. Blog entries become just another kind of page, albeit one in a particular
directory and with a special form for creating new entries.

[Open question: how will this be implemented? How will it interact with the
blog archive?]

[Open question: what about draft entries? Feeds?]
